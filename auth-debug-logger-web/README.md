# Auth Debug Logger

A real-time debugging tool for monitoring authentication flows from OAuth providers and API services. Perfect for developers who need to debug authentication issues in production or development environments.

üöÄ **Live Demo**: [https://auth-debug-logger.vercel.app](https://auth-debug-logger.vercel.app)

## Why Auth Debug Logger?

Debugging authentication flows can be challenging, especially when dealing with:
- OAuth redirects that happen outside your application
- Webhook events from services like Stripe
- Authentication errors that only occur in production
- Complex authentication flows involving multiple services

Auth Debug Logger provides a real-time web dashboard that captures and displays authentication events as they happen, making it easy to identify and fix authentication issues.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: See authentication events as they happen
- **Multi-Service Support**: Google OAuth, Stripe, Twitter, Facebook, and custom services
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by service, status code, or search terms
- **Detailed Inspection**: View full request/response data, headers, and payloads
- **Export Capabilities**: Download logs as JSON for further analysis
- **Secure by Design**: Uses Clerk for authentication and secure API access
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
